Hi, everybody, today I'm going to introduce my ca of my oop course. As you can see 
this is a interface, I create this UI for space ship. Well let's see what we got here.

As you can see, there are three buttons in the control button frame, star map, ship 
info and news. You will find when I click those buttons, they will change color, this 
is the feed back when you click it. Unfortunately, I didn't add any features to the 
button, so when I clicked the button, nothing will happened.

Here is the ship statu, this graph is create by map function and arrays, I use 
arrays to store some value and use map function to get the mapping value to draw on 
his place

Here is the frame I was planned to write the name of this system, I did, just the
words looks so small.

And here is the monitor that I was planning to display something, like star map or 
news. But I had some problem working on it. So it looks very empty.

well, next is the dashboard, I changed some variable in the class so you will find
these two lines rotate speed are different. Next to the dashboard is the movingCube,
maybe a moving square, whatever, I write this to makes this UI more like a space 
ship system, do you remember the UI in Iron man? It looks so cool. Hope those moving
square also makes my UI so cool too.

Next to the moving square is the radar, it create by PVector function.

And the last one is those two clocks, how do you feel with those two clocks? The
first one I used arc() function to simulate the time changing, see, a second and 
another second, here is the minute and the hour and also there is a digital clock
displayed in the center of the circle. It also can display the date. Hope this kind
of clock appear in the future. it's so cool

And this clock, more like a normal clock in our life. I used push and popMatrix to 
help me build this, and the mose helpful function is rotate(), it helps me draw the
clock also helps me create those pointers.

that's all, thanks for your watching.
